# Q4: Comparison Operators
# Take a = 15 and b = 12.
# Check and print the results of the following comparisons:
# ● a > b
# ● a < b
# ● a == b
# ● a != b
# ● a >= b
# ● a <= b

# Solution:
a: int = 15
b: int = 12

# a is greater tha b (a > b) 
print("a > b (15 greater than 12):", a > b)

# a is less than b (a < b)
print("a < b (15 less than 12):", a < b)

# a is eqaul to b (a === b)
print("a == b:", a == b)

# a is not eqaul to b (a != b)
print("a != b:", a != b)

# a is greater than or eqaul to b (a >= b)
print("a >= b:", a >= b)

# a is less than or eqaul to b (a <= b)
print("a >= b:", a <= b)
